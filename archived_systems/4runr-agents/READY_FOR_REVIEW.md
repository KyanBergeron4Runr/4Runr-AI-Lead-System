# 4Runr AI Lead Scraper System Test - Ready for Review

## Implementation Status

The implementation of the 4Runr AI Lead Scraper System Test feature is now complete and ready for review. The following components have been implemented:

### 1. Test Execution Scripts

- ✅ `run_system_test.sh`: Main shell script for running system tests on Linux/macOS
- ✅ `run_full_system_test.sh`: Comprehensive shell script for running full system tests on Linux/macOS
- ✅ `run_full_system_test.bat`: Comprehensive batch script for running full system tests on Windows

### 2. Test Data Management

- ✅ `inject_test_data.py`: Python script for injecting test data into the system
- ✅ `inject_test_data.bat`: Batch script wrapper for Windows users
- ✅ `test_data_templates/test_lead.json`: Template for test lead data
- ✅ `test_data_templates/README.md`: Documentation for test data templates

### 3. Pipeline Execution and Monitoring

- ✅ `run_pipeline_test.py`: Python script for executing the pipeline and monitoring its execution
- ✅ `run_pipeline_test.bat`: Batch script wrapper for Windows users
- ✅ `monitor_logs.py`: Python script for monitoring logs in real-time
- ✅ `monitor_logs.bat`: Batch script wrapper for Windows users

### 4. Documentation

- ✅ `system_test_README.md`: Comprehensive documentation for the system test feature
- ✅ `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`: Summary of the implementation

## Next Steps

1. **Review**: Please review the implementation to ensure it meets the requirements and follows best practices.
2. **Approval**: Once reviewed, please approve the implementation for deployment.
3. **Deployment**: After approval, the system test can be deployed to the EC2 instance.
4. **Execution**: Once deployed, the system test can be executed to verify the functionality of the 4Runr AI Lead Scraper system.

## Execution Instructions

To run the system test on the EC2 instance:

1. SSH into the EC2 instance:
   ```bash
   ssh ubuntu@<ec2-instance-ip>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/4Runr-AI-Lead-System/4runr-agents
   ```

3. Run the system test:
   ```bash
   ./run_full_system_test.sh
   ```

4. Review the test results:
   ```bash
   cat test_results_*/test_results.md
   ```

## Notes

- The system test is designed to be non-destructive, creating backups of any files it modifies.
- After running the test, you can restore the original state of the system by following the instructions in the test report.
- The test is designed to be run on the EC2 instance where the 4Runr AI Lead Scraper system is deployed.
