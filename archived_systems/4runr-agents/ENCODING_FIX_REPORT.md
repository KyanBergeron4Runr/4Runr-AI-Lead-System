# Encoding Fix Report - 4Runr Lead System

## Issue Identified
Names with French characters were displaying incorrectly due to UTF-8 encoding issues:
- "Alain BÃ©dard" instead of "Alain Bédard"
- "Tobias LÃ¼tke" instead of "Tobias Lütke"
- "Ã‰ric Martel" instead of "Éric Martel"
- "Eric La FlÃ¨che" instead of "Eric La Flèche"
- "Hydro-QuÃ©bec" instead of "Hydro-Québec"

## Root Cause
The leads come from a hardcoded list of verified Montreal executives in `4runr-agents/scraper/real_linkedin_scraper.py`. The encoding issues occurred during data processing and storage.

  - Automatic backup creation before fixes

### 2. Integrated Encoding Fixer into System Components
