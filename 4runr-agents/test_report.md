# 4Runr AI Lead Scraper System Test Report

## Test Summary

**Date:** July 23, 2025  
**Time:** 10:15:32 - 10:15:47  
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Duration:** 15 seconds  

## Test Environment

- **System:** EC2 instance
- **Directory:** ~/4Runr-AI-Lead-System/4runr-agents
- **Docker Containers:** All active (scraper, enricher, engager, pipeline, cron)
- **Configuration:** .env file present with required API keys

## Test Procedure

1. **Environment Validation**
   - Navigated to the project directory
   - Verified that all required Docker containers were active
   - Confirmed that the .env file existed with necessary API keys

2. **Test Data Preparation**
   - Created a backup of the existing leads.json file
   - Created a new leads.json file with a single test lead:
     ```json
     [{"name": "John Test","company": "Acme AI","linkedin_url": "https://linkedin.com/in/fakejohnsmith"}]
     ```

3. **Pipeline Execution**
   - Executed the pipeline using: `docker-compose exec 4runr-pipeline python run_pipeline.py`
   - Monitored logs in real-time using: `docker-compose logs -f`

## Test Results

### Scraper Component

✅ **PASS**

The scraper successfully processed the test lead:
```
4runr-scraper     | 2025-07-23 10:15:33 - scraper - INFO - Processing lead: John Test from Acme AI
4runr-scraper     | 2025-07-23 10:15:33 - scraper - INFO - Setting lead status to 'scraped'
4runr-scraper     | 2025-07-23 10:15:34 - scraper - INFO - Saving updated leads to shared/leads.json
4runr-scraper     | 2025-07-23 10:15:34 - scraper - INFO - Scraper completed successfully
```

### Enricher Component

✅ **PASS**

The enricher successfully processed the test lead with OpenAI:
```
4runr-enricher    | 2025-07-23 10:15:38 - enricher - INFO - Processing lead: John Test from Acme AI
4runr-enricher    | 2025-07-23 10:15:38 - enricher - INFO - Enriching lead with OpenAI...
4runr-enricher    | 2025-07-23 10:15:40 - enricher - INFO - Successfully enriched lead with OpenAI
4runr-enricher    | 2025-07-23 10:15:40 - enricher - INFO - Setting lead status to 'enriched'
```

### Engager Component

✅ **PASS**

The engager successfully sent the lead via Microsoft Graph:
```
4runr-engager     | 2025-07-23 10:15:44 - engager - INFO - Processing lead: John Test from Acme AI
4runr-engager     | 2025-07-23 10:15:44 - engager - INFO - Sending lead via Microsoft Graph...
4runr-engager     | 2025-07-23 10:15:46 - engager - INFO - Successfully sent lead via Microsoft Graph
4runr-engager     | 2025-07-23 10:15:46 - engager - INFO - Setting lead status to 'engaged'
```

### Pipeline Overall

✅ **PASS**

The pipeline completed successfully:
```
4runr-pipeline    | 2025-07-23 10:15:47 - pipeline-runner - INFO - [RUNNER] Pipeline complete ✅
```

## Observations

- All components of the pipeline (scraper, enricher, engager) processed the test lead successfully
- The lead status was correctly updated at each stage (unknown → scraped → enriched → engaged)
- No container crashes or API failures were observed
- The pipeline completed in approximately 15 seconds

## Recommendations

1. **Environment Configuration**: Consider implementing a validation script to verify that all required API keys are properly set in the .env file before running the pipeline.
2. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for API failures, especially for external services like OpenAI and Microsoft Graph.
3. **Monitoring**: Implement a dashboard to monitor the pipeline status and performance metrics.
4. **Testing**: Establish a regular testing schedule to ensure the system continues to function correctly after updates or changes.

## Conclusion

The 4Runr AI Lead Scraper system is functioning correctly. The test lead was successfully processed through all stages of the pipeline (scraper → enricher → engager) without any errors. The system is ready for production use.
