- ✅ Edge cases (just suffix) handled correctly

### 2. HTML Fragment Cleaning (75% Success - 6/8 tests)
**Issues Identified:**
- ❌ Missing spaces when removing HTML tags (e.g., "Google LLCSearch" instead of "Google LLC Search")
- ❌ Line break tags not properly converted to spaces

**Working:**
- ✅ Basic HTML tags removed
- ✅ HTML attributes stripped
- ✅ HTML entities decoded
- ✅ Script and style tags removed
- ✅ Mixed content cleaned

### 3. Search Artifact Removal (75% Success - 6/8 tests)
**Issues Identified:**

- ✅ "Learn more" and "Next" links removed
- ✅ Rating fragments cleaned
- ✅ Ad indicators removed
- ✅ Search result numbers removed
- ✅ Clean company names left unchanged

### 4. End-to-End Cleaning (33% Success - 1/3 tests)
**Issues Identified:**
- ❌ Complex cleaning scenarios not producing expected results
- ❌ Integration between cleaning and validation needs improvement
- ❌ Some valid data being rejected due to overly strict validation

**Working:**
- ✅ Complete rejection of garbage data (delisted patterns)

## 🔧 Recommended Improvements

### Priority 1: Company Name Normalization
1. Add normalization rules for:
   - "Corporation" → "Corp"
   - "Limited" → "Ltd" 
   - "Company" → remove or normalize
   - International entities (AG, SA, GmbH, etc.)
2. Improve handling of complex names with special characters
3. Add support for multiple suffix processing

### Priority 2: HTML Fragment Cleaning
1. Add proper space handling when removing HTML tags
2. Convert line break tags (`<br/>`, `<br>`) to spaces
3. Ensure proper spacing in complex HTML structures

### Priority 3: Search Artifact Removal
1. Add patterns for "About X results" removal
2. Add navigation element removal (Images, Videos, News, etc.)
3. Expand pattern coverage for search-specific artifacts

### Priority 4: End-to-End Integration
1. Review validation thresholds to avoid rejecting valid cleaned data
2. Improve integration between cleaning and validation phases
3. Add more comprehensive end-to-end test scenarios

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Strengths
- **Core functionality working**: Essential patterns like Sirius XM removal operational
- **URL validation robust**: 100% success rate on malformed URL detection
- **Text normalization solid**: Good handling of unicode and special characters
- **Individual test success**: 70.9% of individual tests passing

### Areas for Growth
- **Normalization rules**: Need expansion for international and complex business entities
- **HTML processing**: Space handling needs refinement
- **Pattern coverage**: Some search artifacts still getting through
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end scenarios need more work

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix HTML space handling and company normalization rules
2. **Short-term**: Expand search artifact patterns and improve integration
3. **Long-term**: Add comprehensive international business entity support
4. **Testing**: Create more edge case scenarios and real-world data tests
