# Airtable Setup Issue Summary

## 🔍 Issue Identified

The 422 Airtable error occurs because the required fields don't exist in the Airtable table.

**Error Message**: 
```
Unknown field names: engagement_status, email_confidence_level, level engaged
```

**Root Cause**: The Airtable table "Table 1" only contains 3 fields:
- Email
- Full Name  
- LinkedIn URL

But the code expects these fields:
- Engagement_Status
- Email_Confidence_Level
- Level Engaged
- (and 11 other fields for full functionality)

## ✅ Knowledge Base Issue - ALREADY FIXED

The knowledge base structure has been successfully fixed:
- ✅ All required sections present
- ✅ System shows "4Runr knowledge base loaded successfully"
- ✅ No more missing sections errors

## ❌ Airtable Fields Issue - NEEDS MANUAL SETUP

### Required Action
The Airtable table needs to be set up with the required fields manually.

### Critical Fields (Minimum for Basic Functionality)
1. **Engagement_Status** (Single select: Auto-Send, Sent, Skipped, Needs Review, Error)
2. **Email_Confidence_Level** (Single select: Real, Pattern, Guess)  
3. **Level Engaged** (Single select: '', 1st degree, 2nd degree, 3rd degree, retry)

### Complete Field List (14 fields total)
See `setup_airtable_fields.py` output for the complete list with types and options.

## 🚨 Current Status
