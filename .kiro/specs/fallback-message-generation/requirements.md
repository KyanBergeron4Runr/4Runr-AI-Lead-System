# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Fallback Message Generation feature addresses the challenge of creating effective outreach messages for leads that lack sufficient data for personalization (missing email, website, or company description). Instead of skipping these leads or generating generic messages, the system will create bold, strategic messages that maintain the 4Runr brand tone and encourage engagement even with minimal lead context.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sales professional, I want the system to generate compelling messages for leads with limited data, so that I can still engage with high-potential prospects who might otherwise be skipped.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lead has no email address THEN the system SHALL generate a single AI message for manual sending
2. WHEN a lead lacks key personalization data (website, company description) THEN the system SHALL activate fallback message mode
3. WHEN generating fallback messages THEN the system SHALL maintain 4Runr's bold and elevated brand tone
4. WHEN fallback mode is active THEN the system SHALL save the generated message to the AI Message field in Airtable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a marketing operations manager, I want fallback messages to be strategically crafted and curiosity-driven, so that they perform well despite lacking personalization data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating fallback messages THEN the system SHALL create bold and direct messaging that sparks curiosity
2. WHEN personalization data is insufficient THEN the system SHALL focus on strategic value propositions rather than specific company details
3. WHEN crafting fallback messages THEN the system SHALL ensure messages feel strategic and confident, not desperate
4. WHEN limited data is available THEN the system SHALL leverage any available information (name, title, company name) for minimal personalization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want fallback messages to be concise and actionable, so that I can quickly review and send them manually with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating fallback messages THEN the system SHALL keep messages short, clear, and punchy
2. WHEN creating fallback content THEN the system SHALL include a clear reason to connect (meeting, insight, performance boost)
3. WHEN fallback mode is active THEN the system SHALL mark the lead for manual review and sending
4. WHEN a fallback message is generated THEN the system SHALL provide context about why fallback mode was triggered

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear logic for when fallback mode is triggered, so that the system makes consistent decisions about message generation approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lead has no email address THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger fallback mode
2. WHEN a lead has no website data AND no company description THEN the system SHALL trigger fallback mode
3. WHEN fallback mode is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the reason for fallback activation
4. WHEN sufficient data exists for personalization THEN the system SHALL use standard message generation instead of fallback mode
