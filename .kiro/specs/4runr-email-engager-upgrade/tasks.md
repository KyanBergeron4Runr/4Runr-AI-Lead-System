  - Implement `LocalDatabaseManager` class with SQLite operations for engagement data
  - Build database update functionality that syncs with Airtable updates
  - Create engagement history logging as JSON for detailed tracking
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [ ] 5. Implement enhanced AI message generation with 4Runr knowledge
  - Create `MessageGeneratorEnhanced` class with OpenAI integration
  - Build comprehensive prompt that includes 4Runr knowledge base, company summary, and engagement level context
  - Implement cycle-specific tone logic for different engagement levels (insightful intro, strategic nudge, challenge/urgency, bold last pitch)
  - Create message validation to ensure 4Runr brand compliance and system-level language
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ] 6. Extend existing EngagerAgent with enhanced capabilities
  - Create `EnhancedEngagerAgent` class that extends the existing `EngagerAgent`
  - Integrate knowledge base loader, website scraper, engagement tracker, and message generator
  - Implement enhanced `_process_single_lead_enhanced()` method with all new features
  - Update lead validation logic to include engagement level checks
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.5, 3.1, 5.5_

- [ ] 7. Implement enhanced lead processing workflow
  - Update lead processing to load 4Runr knowledge base at startup
  - Integrate website scraping into lead processing pipeline with error handling
  - Add engagement level detection and progression logic to lead processing
  - Implement company-focused message generation with scraped website content
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.5, 3.1, 5.1_

- [ ] 8. Implement robust error handling and logging
  - Create comprehensive error handling for knowledge base loading failures
  - Implement graceful degradation for website scraping failures
  - Add transaction-safe database operations with rollback capabilities
  - Enhance logging to include engagement level tracking and company personalization details
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement autonomous deployment and monitoring capabilities
  - Create health check functionality for all enhanced components
  - Implement status reporting for knowledge base, website scraping, and database operations
  - Add configuration validation for all new environment variables and settings
  - Create monitoring and alerting for critical system failures
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive testing suite
  - Write unit tests for `KnowledgeBaseLoader` with file loading and fallback scenarios
  - Create unit tests for `WebsiteScraperService` with successful scraping and failure cases
  - Implement unit tests for `EngagementLevelTracker` with Airtable integration and level progression
  - Build integration tests for complete enhanced lead processing workflow
  - _Requirements: All requirements validation_

- [ ] 11. Update configuration and environment setup
  - Add new environment variables for knowledge base path, website scraping settings, and engagement tracking
  - Update Docker configuration with new dependencies (BeautifulSoup, requests-html)
  - Create configuration validation for all enhanced features
  - Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of enhanced capabilities
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2_

- [ ] 12. Implement backward compatibility and migration
  - Ensure enhanced system maintains compatibility with existing `EngagerAgent` interface
  - Create database migration scripts for new engagement tracking fields
  - Implement gradual migration path from existing system to enhanced version
  - Build rollback mechanisms for safe deployment and testing
  - _Requirements: All requirements_
