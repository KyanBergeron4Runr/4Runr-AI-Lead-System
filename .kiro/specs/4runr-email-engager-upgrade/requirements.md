# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 4Runr Email Engager Upgrade will enhance the existing working email engagement system to meet 4Runr's standards for personalization, strategic timing, and internal traceability. This upgrade builds upon the current SMTP email sending, daily throttling, database and Airtable status updates, dry run capabilities, and logging infrastructure to add 4Runr knowledge base awareness, company-focused personalization, engagement level tracking, and autonomous deployment capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a 4Runr sales team member, I want the email engager to incorporate 4Runr's knowledge base and brand voice into all messages, so that every outbound email reflects our systems thinking, infrastructure-first mindset, and AI-as-a-layer philosophy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any email message THEN the system SHALL load and use content from `data/4runr_knowledge.md` to inform tone, structure, and examples
2. WHEN crafting messages THEN the system SHALL incorporate strategic elements including systems thinking, infrastructure-first mindset, AI-as-a-layer approach, and business value language
3. WHEN personalizing content THEN the system SHALL maintain 4Runr's bold, professional, system-level communication style
4. IF the knowledge base file is missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL log an error and use fallback 4Runr messaging principles

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a sales automation user, I want the engager to personalize messages based on the target company rather than individual leads, so that emails speak directly to the company's operations and business context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a lead THEN the system SHALL use `company_name` and `company_website` from the database to focus personalization
2. WHEN a company website is available THEN the system SHALL scrape or summarize the site content to understand the company's business
3. WHEN generating messages THEN the system SHALL craft content that speaks to the company's operations rather than individual flattery
4. IF website scraping fails THEN the system SHALL use company name and available data for basic company-focused personalization
5. WHEN building prompts THEN the system SHALL include scraped website summary and company context in the AI message generation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a campaign manager, I want the engager to track and manage engagement levels through Airtable's "Level Engaged" field, so that I can ensure proper progression through engagement stages and avoid over-contacting leads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a lead THEN the system SHALL detect the current engagement stage from Airtable's "Level Engaged" field
2. WHEN determining next action THEN the system SHALL use engagement level to decide appropriate message type and skip over-engaged leads
3. WHEN successfully sending an email THEN the system SHALL update the "Level Engaged" field to the next appropriate stage
4. WHEN updating engagement level THEN the system SHALL also update `last_contacted` timestamp in both Airtable and local database
5. IF a lead is already at maximum engagement level THEN the system SHALL skip the lead and log the decision

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the engager to maintain comprehensive engagement tracking in the local database, so that I can analyze engagement patterns and campaign effectiveness over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the local database SHALL have `engagement_stage`, `last_contacted`, and `engagement_history` fields
2. WHEN processing any lead THEN the system SHALL update the local database with current engagement stage and contact timestamp
3. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL optionally log engagement history as JSON for detailed tracking
4. WHEN database updates fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing without blocking the engagement flow
5. IF database schema is missing required fields THEN the system SHALL create them automatically or log migration requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a sales operations manager, I want the engager to generate messages with cycle-specific tone and logic, so that engagement progression feels natural and strategically appropriate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating 1st degree messages THEN the system SHALL create insightful introductions that reference company context
2. WHEN generating 2nd degree messages THEN the system SHALL provide strategic nudges that build on previous contact
3. WHEN generating 3rd degree messages THEN the system SHALL use challenge/urgency tone while maintaining professionalism
4. WHEN generating retry messages THEN the system SHALL create bold last pitch communications
5. WHEN crafting any message THEN the system SHALL ensure content reflects 4Runr knowledge base, sounds system-level, and references scraped company information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the engager to be deployment-ready with autonomous operation capabilities, so that it can run reliably in production without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed THEN the system SHALL operate autonomously with proper error handling and logging
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information and continue processing other leads
3. WHEN external services fail THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate retry logic and graceful degradation
4. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL provide clear status reporting and health monitoring
5. IF critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL alert administrators while maintaining system stability
