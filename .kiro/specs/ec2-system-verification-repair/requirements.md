# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 4runr system deployed on EC2 is experiencing critical issues with data integrity and functionality. The Airtable database is missing information, setting incorrect values, and the overall system is not functioning properly. This feature will create a comprehensive system verification and repair process to diagnose, identify, and fix all critical issues affecting the production system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to perform comprehensive system health checks, so that I can identify all issues affecting the production system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system verification is initiated THEN the system SHALL check all critical components including database connections, API integrations, and service status
2. WHEN database integrity is checked THEN the system SHALL verify all required tables exist with correct schemas and data consistency
3. WHEN Airtable integration is tested THEN the system SHALL validate field mappings, permissions, and data synchronization accuracy
4. WHEN service health is assessed THEN the system SHALL report the status of all running services and their dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to identify specific data inconsistencies and missing information, so that I can understand the scope of data corruption issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data validation runs THEN the system SHALL compare local database records with Airtable records to identify discrepancies
2. WHEN missing data is detected THEN the system SHALL generate detailed reports showing what information is missing and where
3. WHEN incorrect data is found THEN the system SHALL log specific instances of data corruption with before/after comparisons
4. WHEN field mapping issues are discovered THEN the system SHALL identify which fields are incorrectly mapped or configured

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated repair capabilities for common issues, so that I can quickly restore system functionality without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data repair is initiated THEN the system SHALL automatically fix common data inconsistencies using predefined repair rules
2. WHEN missing records are identified THEN the system SHALL attempt to restore data from backups or regenerate from source systems
3. WHEN field mapping errors are detected THEN the system SHALL correct mappings based on configuration templates
4. WHEN service failures are found THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic service restart and configuration repair

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed logging and reporting of all verification and repair activities, so that I can track what was fixed and monitor system health over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification runs THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports showing all checks performed and their results
2. WHEN repairs are executed THEN the system SHALL log all changes made with timestamps and success/failure status
3. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL create prioritized action items for manual intervention
4. WHEN system health improves THEN the system SHALL provide before/after metrics showing improvement

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to prevent future data corruption and system issues, so that the system remains stable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verification completes THEN the system SHALL implement monitoring checks to detect similar issues early
2. WHEN data synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL validate data integrity before and after sync operations
3. WHEN system configuration changes THEN the system SHALL backup current state and validate new configurations
4. WHEN critical errors are detected THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts to administrators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that all system components are properly configured and communicating, so that the entire pipeline functions correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN component integration is tested THEN the system SHALL verify communication between lead scraper, brain, and outreach systems
2. WHEN API endpoints are checked THEN the system SHALL validate all external service connections and authentication
3. WHEN data flow is tested THEN the system SHALL trace data movement through the entire pipeline to identify bottlenecks
4. WHEN configuration is validated THEN the system SHALL ensure all environment variables and settings are correct for production
