# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Validate the test environment


  - Navigate to the correct project directory on the EC2 instance
  - Verify that all required Docker containers are active
  - Check that the .env file exists and contains necessary API keys
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_



- [ ] 2. Prepare test data
  - [ ] 2.1 Create backup of existing leads.json file
    - Check if shared/leads.json exists


    - If it exists, create a backup copy
    - _Requirements: 2.4_
  
  - [x] 2.2 Create test lead data


    - Create a new leads.json file with a single test lead
    - Ensure the test lead has all required fields (name, company, linkedin_url)
    - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_



- [ ] 3. Execute the pipeline
  - [ ] 3.1 Run the pipeline manually
    - Execute the pipeline using docker-compose


    - Verify that the command executes without immediate errors
    - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
  


  - [ ] 3.2 Monitor pipeline execution
    - Stream logs to the console for real-time observation
    - Watch for any container crashes or API failures


    - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_

- [ ] 4. Validate test results



  - [ ] 4.1 Check enricher processing
    - Examine logs for evidence that the enricher detected the test lead
    - Verify that the enricher successfully processed the lead with OpenAI
    - _Requirements: 4.1_
  
  - [ ] 4.2 Check engager processing
    - Examine logs for evidence that the engager received the enriched lead
    - Verify that the engager attempted to send the lead via the configured channel
    - _Requirements: 4.2_
  
  - [ ] 4.3 Check for errors
    - Examine logs for any API failures or errors
    - Document any issues encountered during the test
    - _Requirements: 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Document test results
  - Compile a summary of the test process and results
  - Include relevant log excerpts
  - Provide a clear pass/fail status with supporting evidence
  - Document any recommendations for identified issues or improvements
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_
