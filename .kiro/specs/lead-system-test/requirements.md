# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 4Runr AI Lead System Test is designed to verify the functionality of the complete lead generation pipeline in the production environment. This test will ensure that all components of the system (scraper, enricher, and engager) are working correctly together by running a controlled test with a sample lead. The test will validate that the system can successfully process a lead through the entire pipeline and produce the expected output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Environment Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify that the test environment is properly configured before running the test, so that I can ensure accurate test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the test THEN the system SHALL verify that the correct project directory is accessed.
2. WHEN validating the environment THEN the system SHALL check that all required Docker containers are active.
3. WHEN checking configuration THEN the system SHALL verify that the .env file exists and contains necessary API keys.
4. WHEN an environment validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages.

### Requirement 2: Test Data Preparation

**User Story:** As a tester, I want to use controlled test data for system testing, so that I can ensure consistent and predictable test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the test THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to inject a controlled test lead.
2. WHEN using test data THEN the system SHALL ensure it is properly formatted as JSON.
3. WHEN preparing test data THEN the system SHALL include all required fields for a lead (name, company, linkedin_url).
4. WHEN injecting test data THEN the system SHALL back up any existing data to prevent data loss.

### Requirement 3: Pipeline Execution

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to run the complete pipeline manually, so that I can verify all components are working correctly together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test THEN the system SHALL execute the complete pipeline (scraper → enricher → engager) in sequence.
2. WHEN executing the pipeline THEN the system SHALL use the Docker command to run the pipeline script.
3. WHEN the pipeline is running THEN the system SHALL provide a way to observe logs in real-time.
4. WHEN the pipeline execution completes THEN the system SHALL verify that no container crashes occurred.

### Requirement 4: Test Result Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify the results of the pipeline execution, so that I can confirm the system is working as expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating results THEN the system SHALL verify that the enricher detected and processed the test lead.
2. WHEN validating results THEN the system SHALL verify that the engager attempted to send the lead via the configured channel.
3. WHEN validating results THEN the system SHALL check for any API failures or errors in the logs.
4. WHEN the test completes THEN the system SHALL provide a clear pass/fail status with supporting evidence.

### Requirement 5: Test Documentation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive documentation of the test process and results, so that I can share the information with the team and use it for future reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting the test THEN the system SHALL include the test procedure with all commands used.
2. WHEN documenting results THEN the system SHALL include relevant log excerpts.
3. WHEN errors are encountered THEN the system SHALL document the specific error and its context.
4. WHEN the test is successful THEN the system SHALL document confirmation of each stage's successful completion.
5. WHEN the test is complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for any identified issues or improvements.
