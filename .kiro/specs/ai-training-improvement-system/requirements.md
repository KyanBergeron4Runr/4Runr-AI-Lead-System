# AI Training & Improvement System - Requirements

## Introduction

This system creates an autonomous AI improvement loop where an AI Training Agent continuously monitors message decisions, analyzes training data, and automatically adjusts the engager agent to improve performance. The system ensures proper data storage, pattern recognition, and automatic optimization without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Message Decision Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all message decisions and outcomes to be automatically monitored and stored, so that the system can learn from every interaction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a message is generated by the AI message generator THEN the system SHALL log the complete decision context including template selection, personalization data, and reasoning
2. WHEN a message is sent through the engager agent THEN the system SHALL track delivery status, engagement metrics, and response outcomes
3. WHEN message outcomes are available (opens, clicks, replies) THEN the system SHALL correlate them with the original decision data
4. IF a message fails or receives negative feedback THEN the system SHALL flag it for priority analysis
5. WHEN storing message decisions THEN the system SHALL include timestamps, lead context, decision reasoning, and outcome labels for training

### Requirement 2: Structured Training Data Storage

**User Story:** As an AI training system, I want all decision data stored in a structured, queryable format, so that patterns can be identified and improvements can be made systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN decision data is collected THEN the system SHALL store it in a standardized JSON schema with consistent field names and data types
2. WHEN storing training data THEN the system SHALL organize it by decision type (message generation, enrichment, engagement) with proper indexing
3. WHEN data reaches storage limits THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent archiving while preserving high-value training examples
4. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL maintain backup copies and alert administrators
5. WHEN querying training data THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date range, success metrics, lead characteristics, and decision outcomes

### Requirement 3: AI Training Agent

**User Story:** As an autonomous system, I want an AI Training Agent that continuously analyzes decision patterns and identifies improvement opportunities, so that the system becomes more effective over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI Training Agent runs THEN it SHALL analyze the last 7 days of decision data to identify patterns and trends
2. WHEN analyzing message generation decisions THEN the agent SHALL identify which templates, tones, and personalization approaches perform best
3. WHEN poor performance patterns are detected THEN the agent SHALL generate specific improvement recommendations with confidence scores
4. IF success rates drop below defined thresholds THEN the agent SHALL trigger immediate analysis and adjustment recommendations
5. WHEN generating improvements THEN the agent SHALL provide A/B testing suggestions and implementation guidance

### Requirement 4: Automatic Engager Agent Adjustment

**User Story:** As an engager agent, I want to receive automatic updates and improvements from the AI Training Agent, so that my performance continuously improves without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI Training Agent identifies high-confidence improvements THEN it SHALL automatically update the engager agent's configuration
2. WHEN template performance data shows clear winners THEN the system SHALL adjust template selection weights automatically
3. WHEN personalization approaches prove more effective THEN the system SHALL update personalization rules and priorities
4. IF automatic adjustments are made THEN the system SHALL log all changes with rollback capabilities
5. WHEN critical performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL implement emergency adjustments and alert administrators

### Requirement 5: Agent Communication System

**User Story:** As a system component, I want agents to communicate effectively about improvements and changes, so that all parts of the system stay synchronized and informed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI Training Agent makes recommendations THEN it SHALL communicate them to relevant agents through a structured messaging system
2. WHEN the engager agent receives updates THEN it SHALL acknowledge receipt and confirm implementation status
3. WHEN agents need to share performance data THEN they SHALL use standardized communication protocols with proper error handling
4. IF communication between agents fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log failures
5. WHEN system-wide changes are needed THEN agents SHALL coordinate updates to prevent conflicts

### Requirement 6: Performance Tracking & Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to track the effectiveness of automatic improvements, so that I can validate the AI Training Agent is actually improving performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automatic improvements are implemented THEN the system SHALL track before/after performance metrics
2. WHEN measuring improvement effectiveness THEN the system SHALL compare success rates, engagement metrics, and conversion rates
3. WHEN improvements show negative results THEN the system SHALL automatically rollback changes and flag for review
4. IF the AI Training Agent's recommendations consistently fail THEN the system SHALL reduce its confidence thresholds and alert administrators
5. WHEN generating performance reports THEN the system SHALL show clear attribution between improvements and results

### Requirement 7: Safety & Override Controls

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want safety controls and override capabilities, so that automatic improvements don't negatively impact the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automatic adjustments are proposed THEN the system SHALL validate them against safety rules and business constraints
2. WHEN changes exceed defined risk thresholds THEN the system SHALL require manual approval before implementation
3. WHEN administrators need to override automatic improvements THEN they SHALL have immediate access to manual controls
4. IF the system detects anomalous behavior THEN it SHALL pause automatic adjustments and alert administrators
5. WHEN emergency situations occur THEN administrators SHALL be able to instantly rollback all automatic changes

### Requirement 8: Continuous Learning Loop

**User Story:** As an AI system, I want to continuously learn and improve from every decision and outcome, so that performance gets better over time without plateauing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new decision data is available THEN the system SHALL incorporate it into the training dataset within 1 hour
2. WHEN patterns change over time THEN the AI Training Agent SHALL adapt its recommendations to current trends
3. WHEN seasonal or market changes affect performance THEN the system SHALL detect these shifts and adjust accordingly
4. IF the system identifies new optimization opportunities THEN it SHALL test them through controlled experiments
5. WHEN the learning loop completes a cycle THEN it SHALL generate insights about what was learned and what improved
