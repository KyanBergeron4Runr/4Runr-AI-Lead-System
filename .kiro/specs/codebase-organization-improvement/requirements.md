# Codebase Organization Improvement Requirements

## Introduction

The 4Runr AI Lead System has grown organically and now consists of multiple interconnected systems across different directories. While functionally complete, the codebase structure makes it challenging to navigate, understand dependencies, and maintain the system efficiently. This spec aims to create a cleaner, more intuitive organization that makes the system easier to work with and scale.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clear System Boundaries

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each system component to have clear boundaries and responsibilities, so that I can quickly understand what each part does and where to make changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at the project structure THEN I SHALL see clearly defined system boundaries with no overlapping responsibilities
2. WHEN I need to work on lead enrichment THEN I SHALL know exactly which directory and files to focus on
3. WHEN I need to work on campaign management THEN I SHALL have a dedicated, well-organized area for that functionality
4. IF I'm looking for email delivery logic THEN I SHALL find it in one logical location without duplicates

### Requirement 2: Consolidated Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all configuration to be centralized and consistent, so that I don't have to hunt through multiple .env files and config locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to configure the system THEN I SHALL have a single, clear configuration entry point
2. WHEN I deploy to different environments THEN I SHALL have consistent configuration patterns across all components
3. WHEN I add new configuration THEN I SHALL have clear guidelines on where and how to add it
4. IF configuration is missing THEN I SHALL get clear error messages pointing to the right location

### Requirement 3: Simplified Directory Structure

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the directory structure to reflect the actual system architecture, so that the codebase is intuitive to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I look at the root directory THEN I SHALL see a logical grouping of related functionality
2. WHEN I need to find core business logic THEN I SHALL not have to search through test files, logs, and utilities
3. WHEN I'm looking for shared utilities THEN I SHALL find them in a clearly designated shared location
4. IF I'm new to the project THEN I SHALL be able to understand the system architecture from the directory structure alone

### Requirement 4: Dependency Clarity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand how different parts of the system depend on each other, so that I can make changes confidently without breaking other components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I modify a shared component THEN I SHALL know exactly which other components might be affected
2. WHEN I need to understand data flow THEN I SHALL have clear documentation of how data moves between systems
3. WHEN I add new functionality THEN I SHALL have clear patterns to follow for integration
4. IF there are circular dependencies THEN I SHALL have a plan to resolve them

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Navigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation that helps me navigate and understand the codebase, so that I can be productive quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start working on the project THEN I SHALL have a clear README that explains the overall architecture
2. WHEN I need to understand a specific component THEN I SHALL find relevant documentation in that component's directory
3. WHEN I need to run or deploy the system THEN I SHALL have clear, step-by-step instructions
4. IF I'm looking for examples THEN I SHALL find them organized separately from production code

### Requirement 6: Clean Separation of Concerns

**User Story:** As a developer, I want production code, tests, configuration, and utilities to be clearly separated, so that I can focus on what's relevant to my current task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm working on production features THEN I SHALL not be distracted by test files and development utilities
2. WHEN I'm debugging THEN I SHALL easily find logs and diagnostic tools
3. WHEN I'm testing THEN I SHALL have a dedicated testing environment that doesn't interfere with production code
4. IF I'm doing maintenance THEN I SHALL have utilities and scripts organized in a logical location

### Requirement 7: Scalability Preparation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase structure to support future growth, so that adding new features doesn't require major reorganization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add new agents or services THEN I SHALL have clear patterns and locations for them
2. WHEN the system grows THEN I SHALL not need to refactor the entire directory structure
3. WHEN I need to extract components into separate services THEN I SHALL have clear boundaries that make this possible
4. IF I need to add new integrations THEN I SHALL have designated places for external service connections
