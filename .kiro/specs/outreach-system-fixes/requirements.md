# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Outreach System Fixes will address critical technical issues preventing the 4runr outreach system from functioning properly. This includes fixing the knowledge base structure that contains essential 4runr brand and philosophy information, and ensuring all dependencies are properly documented for system reproducibility.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the knowledge base to contain all required sections with proper 4runr brand information, so that the engager agent can access essential company philosophy and messaging guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the engager agent loads the knowledge base THEN the system SHALL find all required sections: 'Core Philosophy', 'Systems Thinking', 'Infrastructure-First', 'AI-as-a-Layer', and 'Business Value'
2. WHEN each knowledge base section is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide 3-6 sentence summaries drawn from the 4runr Manifesto and Brand Foundation documents
3. WHEN the knowledge base is loaded THEN the system SHALL use clean JSON format with UTF-8 encoding and no trailing commas
4. WHEN running the engager agent THEN the system SHALL log "âœ… 4Runr knowledge base loaded successfully" instead of missing sections errors
5. IF the knowledge base file is missing THEN the system SHALL create it with the proper structure and content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all system dependencies to be documented in a requirements.txt file, so that I can reproduce the environment and ensure all necessary packages are installed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN the requirements.txt file SHALL contain all necessary packages including pyairtable, validators, bs4, openai, and python-dotenv
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install all required packages
3. WHEN the requirements file is generated THEN the system SHALL include specific version numbers for reproducibility
4. WHEN new dependencies are added THEN the system SHALL update the requirements.txt file accordingly
5. IF dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages indicating which packages need to be installed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want clear setup documentation and environment examples, so that I can quickly get the system running locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the development environment THEN the system SHALL provide a .env.example file showing required environment variables
2. WHEN following setup instructions THEN the system SHALL include clear steps for installing dependencies and configuring the environment
3. WHEN the setup is complete THEN the system SHALL be able to run the engager agent without missing dependency errors
4. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which variables need to be set
5. WHEN testing the setup THEN the system SHALL support a dry-run mode to verify configuration without sending actual messages
