# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Audit current codebase dependencies




  - Scan all Python files in the 4runr-outreach-system directory for import statements
  - Create a comprehensive list of all packages being imported



  - Compare against current requirements.txt to identify missing dependencies
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Update requirements.txt with missing dependencies



  - Add any missing packages identified in the audit to requirements.txt
  - Include specific version numbers for reproducibility
  - Organize dependencies with clear category comments
  - Test installation in a clean virtual environment



  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 3. Restructure knowledge base content to match expected sections
  - Analyze current 4runr_knowledge.md content structure



  - Map existing content to the five required sections: Core Philosophy, Systems Thinking, Infrastructure-First, AI-as-a-Layer, Business Value
  - Restructure the markdown file to include all required section headers
  - Preserve all existing valuable content while organizing it under proper sections
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_




- [ ] 4. Create knowledge base validation test
  - Write a test script to verify the knowledge base passes validation
  - Test that all required sections are found by the KnowledgeBaseLoader
  - Verify UTF-8 encoding and proper JSON structure where applicable
  - Ensure the test can be run independently to validate the fix
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [ ] 5. Test complete system functionality
  - Run the engager agent with --dry-run flag to test knowledge base loading
  - Verify the success message "âœ… 4Runr knowledge base loaded successfully" appears in logs
  - Test that no missing sections warnings appear
  - Confirm the system uses the full knowledge base instead of fallback content
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 1.5_

- [ ] 6. Create setup documentation and environment example
  - Update or create .env.example file with required environment variables
  - Document the installation process using pip install -r requirements.txt
  - Add clear setup instructions for new developers
  - Include troubleshooting steps for common dependency issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_
