# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a robust database system for lead data management that ensures data integrity, prevents duplication, and maintains synchronization between the local database and Airtable. The system will replace the current JSON file-based storage with a proper SQLite database while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring all agents can safely add leads without data corruption.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a centralized database for lead storage, so that all lead data is organized, persistent, and easily queryable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes THEN it SHALL create a SQLite database with proper schema for leads
2. WHEN a lead is added THEN the system SHALL store it in the database with a unique identifier
3. WHEN the database is queried THEN it SHALL return leads in a consistent format
4. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically create necessary tables if they don't exist

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a lead generation agent, I want to add leads to the database without duplicating existing records, so that the database remains clean and accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new lead THEN the system SHALL check for duplicates based on LinkedIn URL and email
2. WHEN a duplicate is detected THEN the system SHALL update the existing record instead of creating a new one
3. WHEN a lead has no LinkedIn URL or email THEN the system SHALL use name and company for duplicate detection
4. WHEN updating an existing lead THEN the system SHALL preserve the original creation timestamp

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data synchronization process, I want to sync leads between the database and Airtable bidirectionally, so that both systems remain consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new leads are added to the database THEN they SHALL be marked for Airtable sync
2. WHEN leads are updated in the database THEN the changes SHALL be propagated to Airtable
3. WHEN Airtable records are updated THEN the changes SHALL be reflected in the local database
4. WHEN sync fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and log failures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want data migration from existing JSON files, so that no existing lead data is lost during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects existing JSON files THEN it SHALL migrate all leads to the database
2. WHEN migrating leads THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing field data
3. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL create backup copies of the original JSON files
4. WHEN migration encounters errors THEN it SHALL log the issues and continue with remaining leads

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean API for lead operations, so that agents can easily interact with the database without complex SQL queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent needs to add a lead THEN it SHALL use a simple add_lead() function
2. WHEN an agent needs to search leads THEN it SHALL use query functions with filters
3. WHEN an agent needs to update a lead THEN it SHALL use an update_lead() function with the lead ID
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and logging

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring, so that I can track database operations and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database operation occurs THEN it SHALL be logged with timestamp and details
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with full stack traces
3. WHEN sync operations run THEN their results SHALL be logged with statistics
4. WHEN the system detects data inconsistencies THEN it SHALL alert administrators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the database to handle concurrent access safely, so that multiple agents can work simultaneously without data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple agents access the database simultaneously THEN operations SHALL be thread-safe
2. WHEN database locks occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with retries
3. WHEN transactions fail THEN they SHALL be rolled back completely
4. WHEN concurrent updates occur THEN the system SHALL use proper locking mechanisms
