# Design Document: Multi-Step Email Campaign System

## Overview

The Multi-Step Email Campaign System extends the existing 4Runr Autonomous Outreach System with sophisticated email sequencing capabilities. This system transforms single-touch outreach into strategic multi-message campaigns that build relationships through progressive engagement. The system generates three strategically differentiated messages (Hook, Proof, FOMO) per lead, manages automated scheduling with intelligent timing, and provides comprehensive campaign analytics while maintaining 4Runr's elevated brand positioning.

The system integrates seamlessly with the existing lead enrichment pipeline, leveraging validated leads and company insights to create personalized campaign sequences that feel natural and strategic rather than automated or pushy.

## Architecture

The Multi-Step Email Campaign System extends the existing modular architecture with new campaign-focused components while maintaining integration with existing lead processing modules:

### System Integration Points

The campaign system integrates with existing components:

1. **Lead Data Integration**: Uses enriched leads with Company_Description, Top_Services, Tone, and Email_Confidence_Level
2. **Validation Gates**: Leverages existing email validation (Real/Pattern only)
3. **AI Services**: Extends existing AI integration for multi-message generation
4. **Airtable Integration**: Adds campaign fields to existing lead tracking
5. **Logging System**: Integrates with existing logging and monitoring infrastructure

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Campaign Generator

The Campaign Generator creates complete 3-message campaigns with strategic differentiation and consistent personalization.

**Interface:**
- `generate_campaign(lead_data, company_data)`: Creates complete 3-message campaign
- `generate_hook_message(lead_data, company_data)`: Creates positioning and curiosity message
- `generate_proof_message(lead_data, company_data)`: Creates differentiation and value message  
- `generate_fomo_message(lead_data, company_data)`: Creates urgency and scarcity message
- `validate_campaign_quality(campaign)`: Ensures all messages meet 4Runr standards
- `ensure_message_progression(messages)`: Validates logical flow between messages

**Implementation Details:**
- Integrates with existing AI/LLM services for message generation
- Uses specialized prompts for each message type (Hook, Proof, FOMO)
- Maintains consistent lead traits and company insights across all messages
- Implements 4Runr tone guidelines: bold, strategic, elevated positioning
- Validates message uniqueness and progression logic
- Stores campaigns in structured format with lead_id, company, and message array

**Message Type Specifications:**

*Hook Message (Day 0):*
- Purpose: Grab attention with strategic insight and light CTA
- Tone: Curious, insightful, positioning-focused
- Structure: Industry insight + strategic question + soft connection request
- Example pattern: "Platform evolution insight → Strategic positioning → Light CTA"

*Proof Message (Day 3):*
- Purpose: Show differentiation through proof points without pitching
- Tone: Confident, evidence-based, value-focused
- Structure: Market observation + differentiation proof + value demonstration
- Example pattern: "Market trend → How others win → Subtle capability hint"

*FOMO Message (Day 7):*
- Purpose: Create urgency about competitive advantage and timing
- Tone: Urgent but professional, scarcity-focused
- Structure: Competitive landscape + time sensitivity + final opportunity
- Example pattern: "Competitor movement → Edge compounds → Final connection offer"
