# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multi-Step Email Campaign System extends the 4Runr Autonomous Outreach System with sophisticated email sequencing capabilities. This system generates and manages multi-message campaigns with strategic timing, personalized content for each step, and comprehensive tracking. Each campaign consists of three strategically crafted messages: Hook (positioning & curiosity), Proof (differentiation & value), and FOMO (urgency & scarcity). The system maintains 4Runr's elevated positioning - bold, strategic, and not pushy - while building relationships through progressive engagement.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Message Campaign Generation

**User Story:** As a business user, I want an AI system that generates complete 3-message email campaigns for each lead, so that I can build relationships through strategic progressive engagement rather than single-touch outreach.

2. WHEN creating Hook messages THEN the system SHALL focus on positioning and curiosity with light CTA
3. WHEN creating Proof messages THEN the system SHALL demonstrate differentiation and value without sounding like a pitch
4. WHEN creating FOMO messages THEN the system SHALL create urgency and scarcity while maintaining professionalism
5. WHEN generating campaigns THEN the system SHALL use consistent lead traits and scraped content across all 3 messages
6. WHEN storing campaigns THEN the system SHALL structure data with lead_id, company, and array of 3 message objects
7. WHEN creating message objects THEN each SHALL contain type (hook/proof/fomo), subject, and body fields

### Requirement 2: Strategic Message Differentiation

**User Story:** As a business user, I want each message in the campaign to serve a distinct strategic purpose, so that leads experience a thoughtful progression rather than repetitive outreach.

1. WHEN generating Hook messages THEN the system SHALL grab attention with strategic insights and light CTAs
