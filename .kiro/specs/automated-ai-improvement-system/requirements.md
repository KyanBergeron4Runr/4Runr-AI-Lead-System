# Automated AI Improvement System - Requirements

## Introduction

This system automatically analyzes AI decisions from the 4Runr lead generation system on a weekly basis to identify performance patterns, optimization opportunities, and implement continuous improvements. The system must be fully automated, well-organized, and provide actionable insights without manual intervention.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Weekly Analysis

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI analysis to run automatically every week, so that I don't need to manually trigger performance reviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Sunday 9:00 AM arrives THEN the system SHALL automatically execute the weekly AI analysis
2. WHEN the analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate both detailed JSON reports and human-readable summaries
3. IF the analysis fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry once after 1 hour
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL organize reports by date and archive old reports

### Requirement 2: Organized Report Management

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want all analysis reports to be automatically organized and easily accessible, so that I can track improvements over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL organize them in dated folders (YYYY-MM-DD format)
2. WHEN reports are older than 90 days THEN the system SHALL automatically archive them to a separate folder
3. WHEN new reports are created THEN the system SHALL maintain an index of all reports with quick access links
4. WHEN accessing reports THEN the system SHALL provide a dashboard view showing trends over time

### Requirement 3: Actionable Improvement Recommendations

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want specific, prioritized improvement recommendations, so that I know exactly what actions to take to optimize performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis identifies issues THEN the system SHALL provide specific action items with priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
2. WHEN recommendations are generated THEN the system SHALL include estimated impact and implementation difficulty
3. WHEN multiple issues exist THEN the system SHALL rank them by potential ROI and business impact
4. WHEN recommendations are implemented THEN the system SHALL track which improvements were applied

### Requirement 4: Performance Trend Tracking

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to see performance trends over time, so that I can measure the effectiveness of implemented improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL compare current metrics to previous weeks
2. WHEN trends are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight improving, declining, or stable metrics
3. WHEN improvements are implemented THEN the system SHALL measure before/after performance impact
4. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL alert and suggest rollback actions

### Requirement 5: Automated System Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automatic monitoring of the AI system health, so that I'm alerted to critical issues immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical metrics fall below thresholds THEN the system SHALL send immediate alerts
2. WHEN system health is "NEEDS_ATTENTION" THEN the system SHALL escalate to high-priority recommendations
3. WHEN consecutive weeks show declining performance THEN the system SHALL trigger emergency analysis
4. WHEN system health improves THEN the system SHALL document what changes led to improvement

### Requirement 6: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the analysis system to integrate seamlessly with existing 4Runr components, so that no manual data collection is required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI decisions are made THEN the system SHALL automatically capture all relevant data
2. WHEN production logs are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure they contain sufficient detail for analysis
3. WHEN analysis runs THEN the system SHALL access all necessary log files without manual intervention
4. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL include data from all system components (scraping, enrichment, messaging, Airtable sync)

### Requirement 7: Scalable Architecture

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the analysis system to scale with growing data volumes, so that performance remains consistent as the business grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log volumes increase THEN the system SHALL maintain analysis performance under 5 minutes
2. WHEN storage grows THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cleanup and archiving
3. WHEN analysis complexity increases THEN the system SHALL use efficient algorithms and caching
4. WHEN multiple analysis types are needed THEN the system SHALL support parallel processing

### Requirement 8: Automated Deployment and Maintenance

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the analysis system to be self-maintaining, so that it requires minimal operational overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically set up all required directories and configurations
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL include self-healing mechanisms where possible
4. WHEN updates are needed THEN the system SHALL support version upgrades without data loss

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Reporting Dashboard

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want a comprehensive dashboard showing all AI performance metrics, so that I can quickly assess system health and ROI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show current week metrics, trends, and alerts
2. WHEN viewing historical data THEN the system SHALL provide interactive charts and filtering options
3. WHEN comparing periods THEN the system SHALL highlight significant changes and their causes
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)

### Requirement 10: Automated Implementation Tracking

**User Story:** As a continuous improvement manager, I want to track which recommendations were implemented and their impact, so that I can measure the ROI of optimization efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN recommendations are provided THEN the system SHALL create trackable improvement tickets
2. WHEN improvements are implemented THEN the system SHALL measure performance changes
3. WHEN measuring impact THEN the system SHALL calculate ROI and effectiveness metrics
4. WHEN improvements fail THEN the system SHALL document lessons learned and adjust future recommendations
