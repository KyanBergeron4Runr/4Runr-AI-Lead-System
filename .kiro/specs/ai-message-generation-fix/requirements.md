# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Message Generation Fix addresses the current system's need to generate personalized AI messages for leads based on their website data and store them in Airtable. The system must ensure all eligible leads have AI messages generated and implement daily verification to catch any missing messages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a sales team member, I want the system to generate personalized AI messages using website data for each lead, so that I can send human-like, contextual messages from my personal account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a lead with website data THEN the system SHALL generate a personalized AI message using the website information
2. WHEN a lead has no website data available THEN the system SHALL leave the AI message field blank
3. WHEN generating AI messages THEN the system SHALL use website insights, company description, tone, and services to create contextual content
4. IF website data exists in Website_Insights or Company_Description fields THEN the system SHALL use this data for personalization
5. WHEN storing the message THEN the system SHALL save it to the "AI Message" field in Airtable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to implement daily verification of AI message generation, so that I can ensure no eligible leads are missing their personalized messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running daily verification THEN the system SHALL check all leads for missing AI messages
2. WHEN a lead has website data but no AI message THEN the system SHALL flag it for message generation
3. WHEN a lead has no website data in response notes THEN the system SHALL skip AI message generation
4. IF response notes indicate "no website" or similar THEN the system SHALL not attempt to generate AI messages
5. WHEN verification is complete THEN the system SHALL log statistics of processed, generated, and skipped leads

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sales operations manager, I want the AI message generation to maintain 4runr's brand voice and personalization standards, so that the messages are ready for human review and sending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating AI messages THEN the system SHALL maintain 4runr's helpful, strategic, non-salesy tone
2. WHEN personalizing content THEN the system SHALL incorporate specific company details and website insights
3. WHEN creating messages THEN the system SHALL ensure they sound human-written and conversational
4. IF website tone is detected THEN the system SHALL adapt the message style to match the prospect's communication style
5. WHEN message generation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other leads

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want the system to validate and track AI message generation quality, so that I can ensure consistent message standards and identify improvement opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating AI messages THEN the system SHALL validate message quality against 4runr standards
2. WHEN storing messages THEN the system SHALL include metadata about generation method and data sources used
3. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL track success rates and generation statistics
4. IF message quality is below threshold THEN the system SHALL flag for manual review
5. WHEN daily verification runs THEN the system SHALL generate reports on message generation performance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the AI message generation to work seamlessly with existing Airtable fields and data structure, so that it integrates properly with current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updating Airtable THEN the system SHALL use the existing "AI Message" field without modifying schema
2. WHEN reading lead data THEN the system SHALL access Website_Insights, Company_Description, Tone, and response notes fields
3. WHEN processing leads THEN the system SHALL respect existing field validation and data types
4. IF Airtable updates fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and error handling
5. WHEN batch processing THEN the system SHALL respect Airtable API rate limits and quotas
