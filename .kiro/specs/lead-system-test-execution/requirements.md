# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 4Runr AI Lead Scraper System Test Execution feature is designed to provide a standardized process for running full system tests on the 4Runr AI Lead Scraper system. This feature will enable system administrators and developers to verify that the entire lead generation pipeline (scraper → enricher → engager) is functioning correctly using controlled test inputs. The test execution process will include environment validation, test data injection, pipeline execution, and results verification.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Test Execution Process

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to execute a full system test of the 4Runr AI Lead Scraper system, so that I can verify all components are working correctly together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing a system test THEN the system SHALL provide a clear step-by-step process to follow.
2. WHEN running the test THEN the system SHALL use a controlled test input with predefined test lead data.
3. WHEN executing the test THEN the system SHALL run the complete pipeline (scraper → enricher → engager) in sequence.
4. WHEN the test completes THEN the system SHALL provide a clear indication of success or failure.
5. WHEN observing the test THEN the system SHALL allow real-time monitoring of logs and execution status.

### Requirement 2: Test Data Management

**User Story:** As a tester, I want to use controlled test data for system testing, so that I can ensure consistent and predictable test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up a test THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to inject controlled test lead data.
2. WHEN using test data THEN the system SHALL ensure it is clearly identifiable as test data.
3. WHEN creating test data THEN the system SHALL include essential fields (name, company, linkedin_url).
4. WHEN a test completes THEN the system SHALL provide options to clean up test data.
5. WHEN managing test data THEN the system SHALL prevent interference with production data.

### Requirement 3: Test Result Verification

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to verify the results of system tests, so that I can confirm the system is working correctly or identify issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN verifying test results THEN the system SHALL check that the enricher successfully processed the test lead.
2. WHEN verifying test results THEN the system SHALL check that the engager attempted to send the lead via the configured channel.
3. WHEN verifying test results THEN the system SHALL check for any container crashes or API failures.
4. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and logs for debugging.
5. WHEN a test completes THEN the system SHALL document the outcome with sufficient detail for troubleshooting.

### Requirement 4: Environment Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to validate the system environment before running tests, so that I can ensure all prerequisites are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a test THEN the system SHALL verify the correct project folder structure exists.
2. WHEN validating the environment THEN the system SHALL check that all required Docker containers are active.
3. WHEN checking configuration THEN the system SHALL verify the presence of required .env files with API keys.
4. WHEN an environment validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how to resolve the issue.
5. WHEN validating the environment THEN the system SHALL verify the system is in a state ready for testing.
