# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 4Runr Autonomous Outreach System is an intelligent lead engagement platform that scrapes company websites, generates personalized outreach messages, and sends them only to validated email addresses. The system consists of four autonomous modules: Website Scraper Agent, Message Generator Agent, Email Validation Upgrade, and Engager Agent. All engagement activities are logged in Airtable with comprehensive tracking. The system maintains 4Runr's helpful, strategic tone while ensuring no outreach is sent to fake or unvalidated leads.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Website Scraper Agent

**User Story:** As a business user, I want an autonomous website scraper that extracts company information from websites, so that I can understand each lead's business context for personalized outreach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN receiving a company_website_url from Airtable THEN the system SHALL scrape the website prioritizing /about, /services, /home, and /contact pages.
2. WHEN scraping fails on structured pages THEN the system SHALL use fallback logic to extract content from any available pages.
3. WHEN processing scraped content THEN the system SHALL remove navigation, footer, and cookie banner text to focus on meaningful content.
4. WHEN extracting company information THEN the system SHALL generate a Company_Description as a brief summary from About/Home pages.
5. WHEN identifying services THEN the system SHALL extract Top_Services as a list or summary of key offerings.
6. WHEN analyzing website content THEN the system SHALL estimate the company Tone (formal, bold, friendly, etc.).
7. WHEN saving results THEN the system SHALL store Website_Insights as raw scraped sections for context in Airtable.

### Requirement 2: Message Generator Agent

**User Story:** As a business user, I want an AI-powered message generator that creates personalized outreach emails, so that each lead receives a custom, high-quality message reflecting 4Runr's tone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating messages THEN the system SHALL use Company_Description, Top_Services, Tone, Lead_Name, Lead_Role, Company_Name, and Email_Confidence_Level as inputs.
2. WHEN creating outreach content THEN the system SHALL generate Custom_Message as a short outreach email in 4Runr's helpful, strategic tone.
3. WHEN determining send eligibility THEN the system SHALL set Engagement_Status to Auto-Send only if Email_Confidence_Level is Real or Pattern.
4. WHEN Email_Confidence_Level is Guess or empty THEN the system SHALL set Engagement_Status to Skip.
5. WHEN message quality is uncertain THEN the system SHALL set Engagement_Status to Needs Review.
6. WHEN crafting messages THEN the system SHALL ensure content is helpful, strategic, tailored to company focus, non-salesy but clear in value.
7. WHEN generating content THEN the system SHALL avoid templates or generic intros, ensuring each message is unique and personalized.

### Requirement 3: Email Validation Upgrade

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want enhanced email validation that classifies email confidence levels, so that outreach is only sent to validated email addresses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing enriched leads THEN the system SHALL classify each email based on its source and reliability.
2. WHEN email is found via direct scrape (mailto: or page copy) THEN the system SHALL mark Email_Confidence_Level as Real.
3. WHEN email follows standard patterns (john.doe@company.com) THEN the system SHALL mark Email_Confidence_Level as Pattern.
4. WHEN email is generated through fallback logic only THEN the system SHALL mark Email_Confidence_Level as Guess.
5. WHEN saving validation results THEN the system SHALL store Email_Confidence_Level (Real/Pattern/Guess) in Airtable.
6. WHEN validating email format THEN the system SHALL perform syntax validation and domain verification.
7. WHEN confidence level is determined THEN the system SHALL use this information to gate message sending.

### Requirement 4: Engager Agent

**User Story:** As a business user, I want an autonomous engager that sends personalized messages only to validated emails, so that outreach efforts are focused on real prospects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing leads for engagement THEN the system SHALL only send messages if Email_Confidence_Level is Real or Pattern.
2. WHEN Email_Confidence_Level is Guess or empty THEN the system SHALL skip the lead and not attempt contact.
3. WHEN sending messages THEN the system SHALL use the Custom_Message generated by the Message Generator Agent.
4. WHEN engagement is completed THEN the system SHALL update Engagement_Status to Sent, Skipped, or Error in Airtable.
5. WHEN messages are sent THEN the system SHALL save Message_Preview as a snapshot of the sent content.
6. WHEN contact is made THEN the system SHALL record Last_Contacted_Date as today's date.
7. WHEN updating records THEN the system SHALL set Delivery_Method to Email, LinkedIn DM, or Skipped based on the action taken.

### Requirement 5: Airtable Field Structure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive Airtable field structure to track all outreach activities, so that engagement history and lead status are properly maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing website data THEN the system SHALL create Company_Description field as Long text for site summary.
2. WHEN saving service information THEN the system SHALL create Top_Services field as Long text for key offerings.
3. WHEN recording website analysis THEN the system SHALL create Tone field as Single select (Bold, Formal, Friendly, etc.).
4. WHEN preserving context THEN the system SHALL create Website_Insights field as Long text for raw scraped content.
5. WHEN tracking email quality THEN the system SHALL create Email_Confidence_Level field as Single select (Real/Pattern/Guess).
6. WHEN storing messages THEN the system SHALL create Custom_Message field as Long text for generated outreach.
7. WHEN tracking engagement THEN the system SHALL create Engagement_Status field as Single select (Sent/Skipped/Needs Review/Error).
8. WHEN preserving message history THEN the system SHALL create Message_Preview field as Long text for message snapshots.
9. WHEN recording contact dates THEN the system SHALL create Last_Contacted_Date field as Date for tracking.
10. WHEN logging delivery methods THEN the system SHALL create Delivery_Method field as Single select (Email/LinkedIn DM/Skipped).

### Requirement 6: Modular Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular system architecture, so that individual components can be run independently and the system is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the system THEN each module (Website Scraper, Message Generator, Email Validation, Engager) SHALL be independently executable.
2. WHEN running components THEN the Message Generator SHALL be runnable independently of other modules.
3. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL follow clear separation of concerns with shared utilities.
4. WHEN implementing modules THEN each SHALL have well-defined inputs and outputs for integration.
5. WHEN creating interfaces THEN modules SHALL communicate through standardized data formats.

### Requirement 7: Quality Assurance and Validation

**User Story:** As a business user, I want quality assurance measures that prevent sending to fake leads, so that 4Runr's reputation is protected and outreach is effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria
