# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 4Runr Pipeline Test Reporting feature ensures accurate and consistent test reporting for the 4Runr pipeline system. This feature focuses on maintaining the correct implementation of test result reporting, particularly for system health status in the test reports generated by the run_pipeline_test.py script.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline test reports to accurately reflect system health status, so that I can quickly identify and address issues in the pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline test is executed THEN the system SHALL generate a test report with a System Health section
2. WHEN no errors are detected in the logs THEN the system SHALL display "✅ PASS" as the System Health status
3. WHEN errors are detected in the logs THEN the system SHALL display "❌ FAIL" as the System Health status
4. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL use the log_analysis.get("errors", []) method to check for errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pipeline test reporting code to be maintained and version controlled, so that changes are tracked and the correct implementation is preserved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are made to the reporting code THEN the system SHALL ensure the changes are committed to version control
2. WHEN reviewing the code THEN developers SHALL be able to see the correct implementation of the System Health status logic
3. WHEN new developers work on the codebase THEN they SHALL have clear documentation about the reporting implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive test reports that include all relevant system health information, so that I can monitor the overall health of the pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test report is generated THEN the system SHALL include error details when errors are detected
2. WHEN a test report is generated THEN the system SHALL include component-specific status information
3. WHEN a test report is generated THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of the overall test status
