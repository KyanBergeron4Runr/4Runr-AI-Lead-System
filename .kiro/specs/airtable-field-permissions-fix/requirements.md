# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 4Runr AI Lead System is experiencing critical failures when updating Airtable records due to field permissions and configuration issues. The system successfully generates AI messages and updates the local database, but fails to sync with Airtable because it attempts to set status values that don't exist in the Airtable Select field options. This breaks the integration for 70% of real leads (all Airtable records with "rec*" IDs), while local test leads work perfectly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Airtable Field Configuration Audit

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to audit all Airtable field configurations, so that I can identify which fields have restricted options that cause update failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system attempts to update an Airtable field THEN it SHALL first verify the field type and available options
2. WHEN a Select field is encountered THEN the system SHALL retrieve all valid options before attempting updates
3. WHEN field configuration is audited THEN the system SHALL log all field types, restrictions, and available options
4. WHEN incompatible field values are detected THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with valid alternatives

### Requirement 2: Status Field Standardization

**User Story:** As a lead processing system, I want to use only valid Airtable status options, so that all record updates succeed without permission errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the message generator sets engagement status THEN it SHALL only use values that exist in the Airtable Select field
2. WHEN "Skipped" status is needed THEN the system SHALL either add it to Airtable or map to an existing equivalent status
3. WHEN status mapping is implemented THEN local database and Airtable SHALL use consistent status values
4. WHEN status updates occur THEN both local and Airtable records SHALL be updated successfully

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Field Mapping

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the system to dynamically adapt to Airtable field configurations, so that field changes don't break the integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL query Airtable to discover current field configurations
2. WHEN Select fields are detected THEN the system SHALL cache valid options for runtime validation
3. WHEN field mappings are created THEN they SHALL be validated against actual Airtable schema
4. WHEN Airtable schema changes THEN the system SHALL automatically adapt without code changes

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling and Fallback

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the system to handle Airtable permission errors gracefully, so that lead processing continues even when some updates fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Airtable updates fail due to permissions THEN the system SHALL continue processing other leads
2. WHEN field validation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt alternative field mappings
3. WHEN critical Airtable errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality using local database only
4. WHEN permission issues are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically resume Airtable synchronization

### Requirement 5: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want centralized configuration for Airtable field mappings, so that I can easily adjust field relationships without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN field mappings are defined THEN they SHALL be stored in a configuration file separate from code
2. WHEN Airtable field names change THEN only the configuration file SHALL need updates
3. WHEN new status values are needed THEN they SHALL be configurable without code deployment
4. WHEN field mapping conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear configuration guidance

### Requirement 6: Validation and Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated validation of Airtable field configurations, so that integration issues are detected before they affect production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system deploys THEN it SHALL validate all configured field mappings against live Airtable schema
2. WHEN field validation runs THEN it SHALL test both read and write permissions for each mapped field
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps
4. WHEN all validations pass THEN the system SHALL confirm full Airtable integration readiness
