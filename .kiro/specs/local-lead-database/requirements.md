# Local Lead Database Requirements

## Introduction

The 4Runr AI Lead System currently relies on Airtable as the primary data store and scattered JSON files for temporary data. While Airtable serves as the production database, we need a local database within the codebase to serve as a centralized data layer for development, testing, caching, and offline operations. This local database will improve performance, enable better data relationships, provide query capabilities, and serve as a backup/sync mechanism with Airtable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local Database Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a local database integrated into the codebase, so that I can store, query, and manage lead data efficiently without relying solely on external services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I set up the system THEN I SHALL have a local SQLite database file created automatically in the project
2. WHEN the application starts THEN I SHALL have all necessary database tables created with proper schema
3. WHEN I need to query lead data THEN I SHALL be able to use SQL queries for complex data operations
4. IF the database file doesn't exist THEN I SHALL have it created automatically with the correct schema

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Lead Data Model

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a complete data model that captures all lead information and relationships, so that I can store comprehensive lead profiles and track their journey through the pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I store a lead THEN I SHALL capture all basic information (name, company, title, email, LinkedIn URL, etc.)
2. WHEN I enrich a lead THEN I SHALL store enrichment data (website analysis, traits, confidence scores, etc.)
3. WHEN I track lead progress THEN I SHALL store pipeline status and timestamps for each stage
4. WHEN I generate campaigns THEN I SHALL store campaign data linked to specific leads
5. IF a lead has multiple interactions THEN I SHALL maintain a complete history of all activities

### Requirement 3: Airtable Synchronization

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want seamless synchronization between the local database and Airtable, so that data remains consistent across both systems and I have redundancy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I sync with Airtable THEN I SHALL pull all current lead data into the local database
2. WHEN I update local lead data THEN I SHALL be able to push changes back to Airtable
3. WHEN there are conflicts THEN I SHALL have clear conflict resolution strategies (Airtable as source of truth)
4. WHEN I'm offline THEN I SHALL be able to work with local data and sync when connection is restored
5. IF sync fails THEN I SHALL have error handling and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Database Operations and API

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean API for database operations, so that I can easily create, read, update, and delete lead data without writing raw SQL.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need to create a lead THEN I SHALL use a simple API method like `create_lead(lead_data)`
2. WHEN I need to find leads THEN I SHALL use query methods like `find_leads_by_status()` or `search_leads(criteria)`
3. WHEN I need to update leads THEN I SHALL use update methods that handle validation and relationships
4. WHEN I need to delete leads THEN I SHALL have soft delete functionality that preserves history
5. IF I need complex queries THEN I SHALL have access to raw SQL execution with proper error handling

### Requirement 5: Data Migration and Backup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data migration and backup capabilities, so that I can safely upgrade the system and recover from data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upgrade the system THEN I SHALL have automatic database schema migrations
2. WHEN I need to backup data THEN I SHALL be able to export the entire database to a portable format
3. WHEN I need to restore data THEN I SHALL be able to import from backup files
4. WHEN I migrate from JSON files THEN I SHALL have tools to import existing lead data
5. IF migration fails THEN I SHALL have rollback capabilities to restore the previous state

### Requirement 6: Performance and Indexing

**User Story:** As a system user, I want fast database operations even with large amounts of lead data, so that the system remains responsive as it scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I query leads THEN I SHALL get results in under 100ms for typical operations
2. WHEN I search by common fields THEN I SHALL have proper database indexes for fast lookups
3. WHEN I have thousands of leads THEN I SHALL still have responsive query performance
4. WHEN I perform bulk operations THEN I SHALL have optimized batch processing capabilities
5. IF the database grows large THEN I SHALL have options for data archiving and cleanup

### Requirement 7: Development and Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database utilities that support development and testing workflows, so that I can work efficiently with realistic data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I'm developing THEN I SHALL be able to seed the database with sample lead data
2. WHEN I'm testing THEN I SHALL be able to reset the database to a clean state
3. WHEN I need to debug THEN I SHALL have tools to inspect database contents and relationships
4. WHEN I'm running tests THEN I SHALL have a separate test database that doesn't affect development data
5. IF I need to analyze data THEN I SHALL have utilities to export data in various formats (CSV, JSON, etc.)

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the local database to work seamlessly with existing pipeline components, so that I can gradually migrate from JSON files without breaking current functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing agents run THEN I SHALL maintain backward compatibility with current JSON file interfaces
2. WHEN I migrate components THEN I SHALL be able to switch from JSON to database operations incrementally
3. WHEN pipeline stages execute THEN I SHALL have the database automatically update lead status and progress
4. WHEN I generate reports THEN I SHALL be able to query comprehensive data across all pipeline stages
5. IF components fail THEN I SHALL have proper error handling that doesn't corrupt the database state
