# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The 4Runr AI Lead System Testing Framework is designed to ensure the reliability and functionality of the complete lead generation pipeline. This framework will provide a structured approach to testing the entire system, from lead scraping to enrichment and engagement, in both development and production environments. The testing framework will focus on validating the end-to-end functionality of the system, identifying potential issues, and providing clear reporting on test results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: End-to-End Pipeline Testing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to run comprehensive end-to-end tests on the lead generation pipeline, so that I can verify all components are working correctly together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test THEN the system SHALL execute the complete pipeline (scraper → enricher → engager) in sequence.
2. WHEN testing the pipeline THEN the system SHALL use controlled test input data to ensure consistent results.
3. WHEN a test completes THEN the system SHALL provide a clear pass/fail status for the entire pipeline.
4. WHEN a component fails THEN the system SHALL identify which specific component (scraper, enricher, or engager) caused the failure.
5. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity between pipeline stages.

### Requirement 2: Component-Level Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test individual components of the lead generation system, so that I can isolate and fix issues in specific modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the scraper THEN the system SHALL verify it correctly generates and formats lead data.
2. WHEN testing the enricher THEN the system SHALL verify it properly adds additional information to leads.
3. WHEN testing the engager THEN the system SHALL verify it correctly processes leads for outreach.
4. WHEN testing any component THEN the system SHALL verify proper error handling and logging.
5. WHEN a component test fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information to aid debugging.

### Requirement 3: Environment Validation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to validate the system environment before running tests, so that I can ensure all prerequisites are met.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting tests THEN the system SHALL verify all required Docker containers are running.
2. WHEN validating the environment THEN the system SHALL check for the presence of required configuration files (.env).
3. WHEN checking configuration THEN the system SHALL verify all required API keys and credentials are properly set.
4. WHEN validating the environment THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity to external services (Airtable, etc.).
5. WHEN an environment validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions on how to resolve the issue.

### Requirement 4: Test Data Management

**User Story:** As a tester, I want to use controlled test data for system testing, so that I can ensure consistent and predictable test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up tests THEN the system SHALL provide a mechanism to inject controlled test data.
2. WHEN using test data THEN the system SHALL ensure it doesn't interfere with production data.
3. WHEN a test completes THEN the system SHALL clean up any test data to prevent pollution of the production environment.
4. WHEN creating test data THEN the system SHALL include edge cases and boundary conditions.
5. WHEN managing test data THEN the system SHALL provide a way to reset to a known state between test runs.

### Requirement 5: Test Reporting

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want detailed test reports, so that I can understand the health of the system and identify issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive test report.
2. WHEN reporting test results THEN the system SHALL include timing information for each component.
3. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL include relevant log excerpts in the report.
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide both summary and detailed views of test results.
5. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for resolving any identified issues.

### Requirement 6: Automated Testing

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to automate system tests, so that they can be run regularly without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up automated tests THEN the system SHALL provide scripts that can be run from the command line.
2. WHEN running automated tests THEN the system SHALL support execution in CI/CD pipelines.
3. WHEN tests are automated THEN the system SHALL provide non-interactive execution options.
4. WHEN automated tests complete THEN the system SHALL store results in a structured format for later analysis.
5. WHEN tests are scheduled THEN the system SHALL provide options for notification of test failures.
