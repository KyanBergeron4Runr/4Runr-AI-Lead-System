# Lead Cache System Requirements

## Introduction

The 4Runr AI Lead System agents need fast access to lead data without constantly hitting the Airtable API. This spec defines a simple lead caching system that pulls leads from Airtable once, stores them locally for fast access, and handles synchronization efficiently.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Local Lead Cache

**User Story:** As an agent, I want fast access to lead data without API delays, so that I can process leads efficiently without waiting for Airtable API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent needs lead data THEN I SHALL get it from local cache in under 10ms
2. WHEN the cache is empty THEN I SHALL automatically pull leads from Airtable once
3. WHEN I access leads THEN I SHALL not hit the Airtable API for every request
4. IF the cache is stale THEN I SHALL have options to refresh it

### Requirement 2: Smart Cache Management

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the cache to stay fresh and synchronized, so that agents work with current data without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN I SHALL automatically load leads into cache
2. WHEN leads are updated locally THEN I SHALL mark them for sync back to Airtable
3. WHEN cache is older than X hours THEN I SHALL automatically refresh it
4. WHEN I manually trigger refresh THEN I SHALL pull latest data from Airtable
5. IF Airtable is unavailable THEN I SHALL continue working with cached data

### Requirement 3: Simple Agent Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple API to access leads, so that agents can get lead data with minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I need all leads THEN I SHALL call `get_all_leads()` and get immediate results
2. WHEN I need leads by status THEN I SHALL call `get_leads_by_status('enriched')` 
3. WHEN I update a lead THEN I SHALL call `update_lead(id, data)` and it handles caching
4. WHEN I need to search THEN I SHALL call `search_leads(query)` for fast local search
5. IF I need fresh data THEN I SHALL call `refresh_cache()` to force update

### Requirement 4: Efficient Synchronization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want efficient sync with Airtable, so that we minimize API calls while keeping data current.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cache is first loaded THEN I SHALL pull all leads from Airtable once
2. WHEN syncing updates THEN I SHALL only push changed leads back to Airtable
3. WHEN refreshing cache THEN I SHALL use incremental updates when possible
4. WHEN sync fails THEN I SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. IF there are conflicts THEN I SHALL use Airtable data as source of truth
