# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Database Maintenance System is a comprehensive cleanup and synchronization tool that performs full database and Airtable maintenance operations. This system addresses the need for periodic cleanup of existing data, duplicate removal, standardization of field values, and synchronization between the local database and Airtable. It provides a "reset" capability to bring both systems to a clean, consistent state with standardized engagement statuses and data quality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive cleanup command that removes duplicates and standardizes data across both the local database and Airtable, so that both systems maintain consistent, high-quality data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup command is executed THEN the system SHALL scan both local database and Airtable for duplicate records
2. WHEN duplicates are found THEN the system SHALL merge or remove duplicates based on configurable rules
3. WHEN data inconsistencies exist between systems THEN the system SHALL synchronize data using the most recent or highest quality version
4. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN both systems SHALL contain identical, deduplicated data
5. IF conflicts cannot be resolved automatically THEN the system SHALL log conflicts for manual review

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a lead management operator, I want to standardize engagement statuses and other field values across all records, so that the system operates with consistent data states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN standardization is requested THEN the system SHALL set engagement status to a specified default value (e.g., "auto_send")
2. WHEN field standardization runs THEN the system SHALL apply consistent formatting to company names, websites, and other fields
3. WHEN null or empty values are found THEN the system SHALL either populate with defaults or mark for data enrichment
4. WHEN standardization is complete THEN all records SHALL have consistent field formats and values
5. IF standardization rules conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize based on configurable precedence rules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data quality manager, I want comprehensive backup and recovery capabilities before any cleanup operations, so that I can restore data if cleanup operations cause issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup operations begin THEN the system SHALL create full backups of both database and Airtable data
2. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity and completeness
3. WHEN recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities to restore previous state
4. WHEN backup storage is full THEN the system SHALL manage backup retention according to configured policies
5. IF backup creation fails THEN the system SHALL abort cleanup operations and alert administrators

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want detailed reporting and logging of all cleanup operations, so that I can track what changes were made and verify the results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleanup operations run THEN the system SHALL log all changes made to each record
2. WHEN duplicates are removed THEN the system SHALL report which records were merged or deleted
3. WHEN data is synchronized THEN the system SHALL report discrepancies found and resolutions applied
4. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive cleanup report
5. IF errors occur during cleanup THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs with recovery suggestions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a lead enrichment pipeline maintainer, I want configurable cleanup rules and policies, so that I can customize cleanup behavior without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN duplicate detection runs THEN the system SHALL use configurable matching criteria (email, company name, etc.)
2. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL apply configurable resolution strategies
3. WHEN field standardization runs THEN the system SHALL use configurable formatting rules
4. WHEN cleanup policies change THEN the system SHALL support configuration updates without system restart
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate settings and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the cleanup system to handle large datasets efficiently, so that maintenance operations don't impact system performance or availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL use batch processing to manage memory usage
2. WHEN operations are long-running THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and status updates
3. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL throttle operations to prevent performance impact
4. WHEN operations are interrupted THEN the system SHALL support resuming from the last checkpoint
5. IF system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust processing speed
