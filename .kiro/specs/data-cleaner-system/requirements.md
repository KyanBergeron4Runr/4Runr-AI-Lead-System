# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Data Cleaner System is a critical data quality improvement feature that intercepts all scraped lead data before it reaches Airtable. Currently, the lead enrichment pipeline has a 100% success rate but produces garbage data quality, including Google search artifacts, HTML fragments, and malformed company information. This system will ensure only clean, professional data is saved to the database, achieving 110% data quality standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a lead enrichment system operator, I want all scraped data to be automatically cleaned and validated before storage, so that only high-quality, professional data reaches Airtable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw scraped data is received THEN the system SHALL intercept it before Airtable storage
2. WHEN data contains Google search artifacts THEN the system SHALL remove them completely
3. WHEN data contains HTML fragments THEN the system SHALL clean and extract meaningful text
4. WHEN data contains malformed company names THEN the system SHALL normalize them to professional format
5. IF data quality is below acceptable standards THEN the system SHALL reject the data entirely

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data quality auditor, I want comprehensive logging of all cleaning and validation decisions, so that I can track what data was processed and why certain data was rejected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is cleaned THEN the system SHALL log the original and cleaned versions
2. WHEN data is rejected THEN the system SHALL log the rejection reason and criteria failed
3. WHEN cleaning rules are applied THEN the system SHALL log which rules were triggered
4. WHEN validation checks run THEN the system SHALL log the validation results
5. IF audit trail is requested THEN the system SHALL provide complete processing history

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a lead enrichment pipeline maintainer, I want the data cleaner to integrate seamlessly with the existing enricher, so that no changes are required to upstream or downstream systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN enricher produces raw data THEN the system SHALL automatically process it through the cleaner
2. WHEN data passes validation THEN the system SHALL forward clean data to Airtable in expected format
3. WHEN data fails validation THEN the system SHALL prevent Airtable storage without breaking the pipeline
4. IF cleaner fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to original behavior with error logging
5. WHEN integration is complete THEN existing enricher API contracts SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable cleaning rules and validation criteria, so that I can adjust data quality standards without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN cleaning rules need updates THEN the system SHALL support configuration-based rule changes
2. WHEN validation criteria change THEN the system SHALL allow threshold adjustments via configuration
3. WHEN new data sources are added THEN the system SHALL support extensible cleaning rule sets
4. IF rule configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate config and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN rules are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes without requiring system restart

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a lead quality analyst, I want detailed metrics on data cleaning effectiveness, so that I can measure improvement in data quality over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is processed THEN the system SHALL track cleaning success rates
2. WHEN data is rejected THEN the system SHALL categorize rejection reasons for analysis
3. WHEN cleaning rules are applied THEN the system SHALL measure rule effectiveness
4. IF quality metrics are requested THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive quality reports
5. WHEN quality trends change THEN the system SHALL alert administrators to potential issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a lead enrichment user, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that unusual but valid data is not incorrectly rejected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN company names have unusual but valid formats THEN the system SHALL preserve them
2. WHEN websites have non-standard but legitimate domains THEN the system SHALL accept them
3. WHEN data contains mixed languages THEN the system SHALL handle international content appropriately
4. IF edge case patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL learn and adapt validation rules
5. WHEN manual review is needed THEN the system SHALL flag data for human verification
