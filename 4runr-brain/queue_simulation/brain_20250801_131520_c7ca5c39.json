In the pursuit of performance optimization, most companies are merely grafting AI onto outdated systems - a solution that's far from ideal.\nAt 4Runr, we're focused on transformative results. We've successfully transitioned teams from disorganized tools to unified, efficient systems, virtually overnight. Our clients have seen significant improvements in productivity, efficiency, and overall performance.\nWe're not about fluff or temporary fixes. We're about compounding performance and results that make a genuine difference.\nI'm curious, Randal - what's your current approach to optimizing operations at SFM?\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
