It's not a patchwork task, it's a transformation.\nAt 4Runr, we've turned this challenge into a strategic advantage for businesses. We've successfully transitioned teams from disjointed tools to robust, unified systems \u2014 virtually overnight. The result? An average performance improvement of 35% in the first quarter alone.\nWe're not just about AI; we're about compounding performance and streamlined operations. I'm curious, Yves-Gabriel, how does Teck Resources currently approach operational efficiency?\nLooking forward to your thoughts.\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
