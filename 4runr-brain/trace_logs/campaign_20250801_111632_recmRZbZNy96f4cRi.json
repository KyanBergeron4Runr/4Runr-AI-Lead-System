However, we often notice businesses merely duct-taping AI onto existing systems, which hardly reaps the full benefits.\nAt 4Runr, we've transformed this narrative. Our clients have experienced a shift from scattered tools to seamlessly integrated AI systems \u2014 almost overnight. This results in a significant uplift in operational efficiency and performance.\nOur approach is straightforward: no fluff, just compounding performance. We're driven by delivering tangible results that transform businesses.\nI'm curious, Randal, how is SFM currently leveraging its operational strategies? Are you experiencing the transformation you hoped for?\nBest,\n[Your Name]",
