- ‚úÖ **Adaptive sleep cycles** working (30s intervals)

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS

### 1. Test the Autonomous System
```bash
python autonomous_4runr_organism.py --test
```

### 2. Run as Living Organism (Short Test)
```bash
python autonomous_4runr_organism.py --run --cycles 5 --interval 30
```

### 3. Deploy for Production (24/7 Operation)
```bash
python autonomous_4runr_organism.py --run --cycles 1000 --interval 300
```

### 4. Background Deployment (Linux/Unix)
```bash
nohup python autonomous_4runr_organism.py --run --cycles 1000 --interval 300 > organism.log 2>&1 &
```

## üß¨ HOW THE ORGANISM WORKS

### Autonomous Behavior:
1. **Health Check** - Monitors database, Airtable, system vitals
2. **Smart Decision Making** - Determines if new prospects needed
3. **Prospect Generation** - Creates quality SMB/startup leads
4. **Intelligent Enrichment** - Adds all missing data automatically
5. **Database Management** - Saves and tracks all data
6. **Airtable Sync** - Updates CRM in real-time
7. **Adaptive Rest** - Sleeps between cycles, adjusts timing
8. **Self-Reporting** - Logs all activities and status

### Organism Intelligence:
- **Maintenance Mode**: Generates 1 prospect when system is healthy
- **Growth Mode**: Generates 3 prospects when leads are low
- **Self-Healing**: Adjusts sleep time based on success/failure
- **Quality Focus**: Only creates decision-maker prospects (Founders, CEOs)
- **Industry Targeting**: Focuses on SaaS, Marketing, E-commerce
- **Size Filtering**: Targets 10-100 employee companies (SMBs)

## üìä AUTONOMOUS FEATURES

### Health Monitoring:
- Database connectivity and integrity
- Airtable API connectivity and response time

- Self-optimizes for maximum efficiency
- Learns from success/failure patterns

### Error Handling:
- Graceful failure recovery
- Automatic retry logic with backoff
- Critical health issue detection
- Autonomous problem resolution

## üéØ QUALITY ASSURANCE

### Prospect Quality:
