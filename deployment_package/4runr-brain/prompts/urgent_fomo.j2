LOW-CONTEXT STRATEGY:
This is the final message in a low-context sequence. Create urgency about competitive timing and position this as an exclusive opportunity that won't be relevant to everyone.

TONE: Urgent but selective. Confident that we're valuable and they should act.

- Strong, direct call-to-action
- Keep under 75 words
- End with clear next step

EXAMPLES OF APPROACH:
- "This won't be relevant to everyone."
- "But if you're serious about future-proofing your ops, we should talk."
- "Some of your competitors already are."

STRUCTURE:
1. Positioning statement about selectivity
2. Conditional relevance (if you're serious about X)
3. Competitive urgency
4. Clear call-to-action
