## ðŸ”§ Implementation Details

### Advanced Google Search Engine

**Playwright Integration:**
- Headless browser automation with anti-detection measures
- Random user agent rotation for human-like behavior
- Optimized browser settings for performance and stealth

**Search Query Construction:**
```python
def _build_search_query(self, full_name: str, company_name: str = None) -> str:
    # Clean and format names
    full_name = full_name.strip().replace('"', '')
    
    if company_name:
        company_name = company_name.strip().replace('"', '')
        base_query = f'"{full_name}" "{company_name}"'
    else:
        base_query = f'"{full_name}"'
    
    # Add site restrictions for business domains
    site_restrictions = ' OR '.join([f'site:{domain}' for domain in self.search_domains])
    query = f'{base_query} ({site_restrictions})'
    
    return query
```

**Multi-Strategy Result Extraction:**
1. **Primary Selectors**: Standard Google result structures
2. **Alternative Selectors**: Backup parsing methods
3. **Fallback Extraction**: Alternative result discovery
4. **Ad Filtering**: Ensures only organic results are processed

### Anti-Detection Features

**Browser Configuration:**
- Headless mode with stealth settings
- Disabled automation detection features
- Optimized for speed (disabled images, JS when not needed)
- Random delays to simulate human behavior

**Rate Limiting Protection:**
- Configurable retry delays
- Maximum retry limits
- Human-like interaction patterns
- Respectful search frequency

### Robust URL Processing

**Google Redirect Handling:**
```python
# Handle Google redirect URLs
if '/url?q=' in url:
    parsed = urllib.parse.parse_qs(urllib.parse.urlparse(url).query)
    if 'q' in parsed:
        url = parsed['q'][0]
```

**Domain Validation:**
- Validates against business domain extensions
- Filters out social media and non-company sites
- Ensures proper URL structure and accessibility

**URL Cleaning Pipeline:**
1. Extract from Google redirects
2. Add protocol if missing
3. Validate URL structure
4. Check domain extension
5. Filter non-business domains

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Examples

### Basic Website Search
```python
from utils.google_scraper import search_company_website_google_sync

# Search with name and company
website = search_company_website_google_sync("John Smith", "TechCorp")
if website:
    print(f"Found website: {website}")
else:
    print("No website found - will set Enrichment Status to 'Failed - No Website'")
```

### Async Search
```python
from utils.google_scraper import search_company_website_google

# Async search
website = await search_company_website_google("Jane Doe", "StartupXYZ")
```

### Integration with Lead Processing
```python
# Conditional execution based on existing website
if lead.get("Website") is None or lead.get("Website") == "":
    # Trigger Google fallback search
    website = search_company_website_google_sync(lead["name"], lead.get("company"))
    
    if website:
        lead["website"] = website
        # Will be synced to Airtable automatically
    else:
        # Set enrichment status to indicate failure
        lead["enrichment_status"] = "Failed - No Website"
```
