# Smart Search Strategy for Quality Prospects

## Target Profile (Ideal Customer Profile)
- **Company Size**: 10-100 employees (SMB, not enterprise)
- **Decision Makers**: Founders, CEOs, Owners, Directors
- **Industries**: SaaS, Marketing Agencies, E-commerce, Tech Services
- **Growth Stage**: Growing/scaling businesses (not startups or Fortune 500)
- **Geographic**: English-speaking markets (US, Canada, UK, Australia)

## Search Techniques That Work
1. **Industry + Role Targeting**
   - "founder saas" "10-50 employees"
   - "ceo marketing agency" "boutique"
   - "owner ecommerce" "growing"

2. **Company Size Indicators**
   - "small business"
   - "growing company"
   - "boutique"
   - "independent"
   - "family business"

3. **Exclusion Filters**
   - Exclude: "fortune 500", "enterprise", "corporation", "global"
   - Exclude: Large known companies (Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc.)

## Quality Scoring System
- **90-100**: Founder/CEO of growing SMB (20-100 employees)
- **80-89**: Director/VP at boutique agency or tech company
- **70-79**: Manager at small business with growth potential
- **60-69**: Professional at relevant company
- **Below 60**: Not qualified (too large, wrong role, etc.)

## Search URL Generation
Auto-generate targeted searches like:
- "founder" "b2b saas" "20-50 employees" site:linkedin.com -"enterprise"
- "ceo" "marketing agency" "boutique" site:linkedin.com -"global"
- "owner" "ecommerce" "growing" site:linkedin.com -"fortune 500"

This approach finds the right prospects - decision makers at growing businesses
who have budget and need solutions, not employees at large corporations.
