### Advanced Business Intelligence Extraction

**System Prompt Design:**
```
You are an AI business analyst specializing in lead qualification and business intelligence extraction.

Analyze the following website content and extract key business information. Focus on identifying the company's business model, target market, services, and potential challenges.

Based on this content, provide a JSON response with the following fields:

1. Business_Type: Single string categorizing the business (e.g., "SaaS", "Agency", "E-commerce", "Consulting", "Law Firm", "Healthcare", "Manufacturing", "Non-Profit", "Local Service", "Startup")

2. Business_Traits: Array of strings describing key business characteristics (e.g., ["B2B", "High-Ticket", "Technical Team", "Remote-First", "Enterprise-Focused", "Local Services", "Subscription-Based", "Service-Heavy"])

3. Pain_Points: Array of strings identifying likely business challenges (e.g., ["Lead generation", "Manual workflows", "Scaling operations", "Client retention", "Process automation", "Team coordination"])

4. Strategic_Insight: Single string with actionable insight for sales/marketing approach (e.g., "Strong candidate for automation tools given manual process mentions")
```

### Content Processing Pipeline

**1. Content Validation:**
- Minimum content length validation (100+ characters)

- Generic content filtering
- Quality assessment before AI processing

**2. Content Preparation:**
- Combines page title, meta description, and main content
- Limits content length for API efficiency (8,000 chars max)
- Adds lead context (company name, email domain) when available
- Structures content for optimal AI analysis

**3. AI Analysis:**
- Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for cost-effective analysis
- Temperature 0.3 for consistent results
- Max 1000 tokens for focused responses
- 30-second timeout for reliability

**4. Response Processing:**
- JSON parsing with error handling
- Field validation and type checking
- Result enhancement with metadata
- Fallback result generation on failures

## üîß Production-Ready Features

### Robust Error Handling

**API Failure Handling:**
```python
def _create_fallback_result(self, error_reason: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return {
        'Business_Type': 'Unknown',
        'Business_Traits': [],
        'Pain_Points': [],
        'Strategic_Insight': '',
        'extraction_success': False,
