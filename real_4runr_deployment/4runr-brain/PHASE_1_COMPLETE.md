## 🧪 Testing Results

### Core Logic Test ✅
```
🧠 Testing Campaign Brain Flow
========================================
📋 Processing lead: Sarah Johnson at CloudTech Solutions

🔍 Step 1: Trait Detection
  Detected traits: ['enterprise', 'saas', 'role_vp']
  Primary trait: saas
  Confidence scores: {'enterprise': 30, 'saas': 60, 'role_vp': 40}

📋 Step 2: Campaign Planning
  Messaging angle: platform_optimization
  Campaign tone: technical
  Sequence: platform_hook → integration_proof → market_fomo

📧 Step 3: Message Generation
  Generated 3 messages:
    1. platform_hook: Strategic opportunity for CloudTech Solutions
    2. integration_proof: How companies like CloudTech Solutions are staying ahead
    3. market_fomo: Final thoughts on competitive timing

⭐ Step 4: Quality Review
  Overall quality score: 80.0/100

🚪 Step 5: Quality Decision
  ✅ APPROVED (score 80.0 >= 80.0)

🎯 Final Status: APPROVED

🎉 Campaign Brain Flow Test PASSED!
