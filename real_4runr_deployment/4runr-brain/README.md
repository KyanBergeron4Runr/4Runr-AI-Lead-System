# 🧠 LangGraph Campaign Brain

The intelligent "thinking layer" of the 4Runr Autonomous Outreach System. This LangGraph-powered AI agent dynamically manages lead trait detection, campaign planning, message generation, quality scoring, and queue injection through a connected graph of specialized nodes.

## 🎯 Overview

The Campaign Brain replaces rule-based campaign flows with an intelligent AI agent that:

- **Detects lead traits** using rule-based analysis (upgradeable to GPT)
- **Plans campaigns** by mapping traits to optimal messaging sequences
- **Generates messages** using GPT-4o with specialized prompts
- **Reviews quality** across personalization, strategic insight, tone, and clarity
- **Makes decisions** through quality gates with intelligent retry logic
- **Manages memory** to learn from previous interactions
- **Injects campaigns** into the delivery queue system

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Lead Input → trait_detector → memory_manager → campaign_planner → message_generator
                                                                         ↓
Queue Injection ← injector ← quality_gatekeeper ← message_reviewer ←────┘
                      ↓
                 (retry loop if quality fails)
```

### Core Nodes

1. **TraitDetectorNode** - Analyzes lead/company data to identify strategic characteristics
2. **MemoryManagerNode** - Tracks lead history and provides contextual insights
3. **CampaignPlannerNode** - Maps traits to optimal messaging sequences and angles
4. **MessageGeneratorNode** - Uses GPT-4o with modular prompts to create personalized messages
5. **MessageReviewerNode** - Evaluates quality across multiple dimensions
6. **QualityGatekeeperNode** - Makes pass/fail decisions and manages retry logic
7. **InjectorNode** - Delivers approved campaigns to the message queue
